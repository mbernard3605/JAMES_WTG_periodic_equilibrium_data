Data and code to produce figures for "Moisture modes with an oscillating vertical motion profile shape in steady-state weak temperature gradient simulations"
ERA5_EOFS.mat - mat file containing the vertical motion ERA's
WTG_vert_advection_new.m - matlab script that creates the plots seen in the manuscript
anglecolormap5.mat - mat file containing top-heaviness angle colormap
calc_qvstar.m - function that computes the saturation moisture from temperature and pressure
calc_top_heaviness.m - function that calculates top-heaviness from vertical motion and pressure
midData.m - function that computes a time series in-between the input time-step
pres.mat - mat file with pressure data
wrfout_east_85RH_avg - netcdf file containing WRF WTG domain averaged output
